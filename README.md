# chatter-box-be

The following is a Node JS back-end that is built using express and is connected to a MongoDB which uses Mongoose to talk to the DB. 
The following APIs involve registering a new user and logging in to a previous user. Then displaying posts and being able to create a new post along with being able to view their profile. 

Still a work in progress but plan to add features such as more profile management, adding & displaying friends and basic chat functionality.
